AI red teaming is a process of stress-testing AI systems to find vulnerabilities, biases, or failure cases. It helps improve robustness and safety before deployment.

AI alignment ensures AI systems behave in ways aligned with human goals and values. Misaligned models can cause harm even when performing correctly from a technical perspective.

Guardrails are tools used to set constraints on AI outputs, ensuring they follow ethical, safe, and useful guidelines. They can prevent AI from generating harmful or biased content.

Open-source safety tools like "Rebuff" and "Helm" help researchers and developers test, evaluate, and monitor safety in language models.

Interpretability research helps us understand how language models make decisions, improving trust and safety in AI deployment.
